Title: Peer-to-Peer Book Exchange Portal

Objective
Create a mini full-stack web app that connects two types of users:
Book Owners: People who want to give away or rent books
Book Seekers: People searching for books to rent or exchange
You’ll implement basic user flows, listings, and simple data handling using React + Next.js, Node.js, and optional deployment.
Features to Implement
1. User Profiles (Owners + Seekers)
Two types of users:
Book Owner → Can list books
Book Seeker → Can browse listings


Profile creation should include:
Name
Mobile Number
Email
Password (no encryption needed; keep it simple)
Role: Owner or Seeker


Save user profiles in-memory or to a file (DB optional)
2. Book Listing Interface
Only Book Owners can add listings
Fields: Title, Author, Genre (optional), City/Location, Contact Email/Phone
Anyone (Owner or Seeker) can browse listings
Display Title, Author, Owner Info, Location
Optionally allow:
Searching/filtering by title or location
“Mark as Rented/Exchanged” status toggle


3. Authentication (Basic)
No full auth system required


Just implement a mock login via Email + Password
Match against stored users
Redirect to relevant dashboard (Owner vs Seeker)


Bonus Features (Optional)
Edit/delete your own book listings
Filter listings by Genre/Location
Add Book cover (image upload optional)
Deploy frontend + backend

We will take the assignment beyond these 3 days as well, so you need not worry. The only disadvantage would be late interview rounds. 


Secret Tip: You can submit partially completed assignment as well and can inform us about the same in 3 days via submission form and wellfound and can complete the other part and re-update us on wellfound or edit the above submission link XD
